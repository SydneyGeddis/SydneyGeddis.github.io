Want to become a gifted coder, a creative designer, a storyteller or perhaps you even aspire to be a budding entrepreneur? The Games Industry is one of the fastest-growing markets with exciting opportunities opening up right here on our doorstep in Northern Ireland, UK and further afield.</p>

                <p>Applicants should have at least 4 GCSE's at Grade C or above or other relevant qualifications. In circumstances where there are more applications for the course than there are places available, the College reserves the right to ask for higher grades.</p>

                <h6>Pathways:</h6>

                <p>Higher Education</p>

                <p>This qualification is equivalent to 3 A-Levels, giving students the potential to progress to university upon completion. Students have progressed to study Games Design, Games Art, Games Programming, Computing, Web and App Development and Marketing. Graduates of this Extended Diploma course will also be able to apply to the College's Higher Education Creative Media programmes, such as the Level 5 Web and App Development HND.</p>

                <p>Games Development</p>
                <p>There is no one way into the games industry. Junior developers may apply to join a current studio, apply for funding to start their own companies or take on freelance work depending on the strength of their portfolio work and relevant skills. This year we've also seen students selected for Northern Ireland Screen's Pixel Mill Trainees skills development programme.</p>
